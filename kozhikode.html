          <h3>Kozhikode Beach</h3>
          <img src="./Pictures/kozhikodebeach.jpg" class="img-thumbnail" alt="kozhikodebeach">
          <p>Situated on the Malabar coast and endowed with natural beauty, Kozhikode beach should be a must in the itinerary of your visit to the city. This beach is renowned for the sunsets that tourists throng here to enjoy. Though the water is muddy and not suitable for swimming, still the stunning view of the Arabian Sea that the lighthouse offers more than compensates for the shortcoming.

            Payannakal, Putiyappa, Elathur, Beypore, all these beaches are part of the long stretch of Kozhikode beach. This beach lies on the western side of the city and is easily accessible through the four roads in the city.  </p>

          <p>  
            Kadalundi Bird Sanctuary is the perfect tourist spot for bird watchers and nature lovers. Just 19 km away from Kozhikode, this bird sanctuary is home to nearly 100 species of native birds and over 60 species of migratory birds. This is situated among the clusters of small islands on river Kadalundi. This is the habitat of gulls, terns, herons, and other alien birds which are a major attraction of this sanctuary.

Apart from the birds, the sanctuary is famous for its scenic beauty and holds a panoramic view of the river and the Arabian Sea. This sanctuary is also known for the various kinds of fishes, crabs, and mussels. Early morning hours are the best time to visit to watch the birds</p>

          <h3>Thusharagiri Fall</h3>
          <img src="./Pictures/thusharagiri.jpg" class="img-thumbnail" alt="thusharagiri">
          <p>Enjoy the breathtaking beauty of Thusharagiri Fall when you pay a visit to Kozhikode.  Two streams originating from the Western Ghats meet at this point to create the Chalipuzzha River. The river further trifurcates to create three waterfalls and the free-falling water creates a mist, thus giving the name “Thusharagiri”.

            This place has a lovely view all around and you get plenty of activities to indulge in. You may go for trekking, or enjoy rock-climbing. You can also take a break to visit the wildlife sanctuaries or sit on the banks of the river to enjoy the waterfalls. The lush green forest and cool water of the streams all around add to your enjoyment.  </p>

          <h3>Kappad Beach</h3>
          <img src="./Pictures/kappad.jpg" class="img-thumbnail" alt="kappad">
          
          <p>Kappad Beach has historically played an important role in the history of Kerala. On these shores, over 500 years ago in 1498, 170 men led by Vasco- da-Gama first stepped onto Kerala. The entire State, especially the Malabar Coast, would never be the same again.

            A visit to Kozhikode is incomplete without a visit to this legendary site. The spice route flourished through this Beach. A walk in and around the place gives one an idea of itshistorical relevance. The rocks and small hills add to its charm. The nearby shacks are always stocked with excellent local delicacies and tea. Migratory birds can be spotted occasionally as well. Kappad Beach is a truly majestic destination, which will always hold an important place in our history.</p>
