        <img src="./Pictures/mamburam.jpg" class="img-thumbnail" alt="mamburam">
        <p>A famous Muslim Pilgrimage in the Malappuram district, Mamburam is a shrine dedicated to the dead bodies of some of the primary Thangals of Kerala. It was a title given to the Arabs from Yemen who scattered from there and migrated to Kerala. 

          They held great importance to the locals of Kerala and thus, had this shrine dedicated to them. A local festival held here during the time of Muharram is one of the primary attractions of this place.

        <img src="./Pictures/bharathapuzha.jpg" class="img-thumbnail" alt="bharathapuzha">
        <p>The River of Bharata, also known as Nila, the Bharathapuzha River is a west-flowing river in the state of Kerala, and is the second longest river in the state. The river has been an integral part of life in the southern regions of Malabar. The name Nila has been given to the river to show the importance of it being more than just a river, as there are several mentions of the river in the ancient Hindu scriptures. 

          All along the river, there are about 11 dams made to use its waters for the purpose of irrigation. Culturally, the river has an importance in a number of parts of the state, like the famous Kerala Kalamandalam which is housed on the banks of the river.</p>

        <p>Another attraction of Malappuram that is often compared to the famous town of Ooty, Kodikuthimala is definitely a sight for the sore eyes. A hill station of Kerala, the place is perched on a height of about 522 m above sea level, and is the highest point in the Amminikkadan hills. 

          Once the spot where the Britishers once hoisted their flag, the spot was opened for tourism only a few decades ago, with a large area of the place marked already for future development projects. There is a watch tower on the top of the hill from where tourists can get a panoramic view.</p>
