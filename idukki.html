        <h3>Ilaveezha Poonchira</h3>
        <img src="./Pictures/Ilaveezhapoonjira.jpg" class="img-thumbnail" alt="Ilaveezha Poonchira">
        <p>Ilaveezha Poonchira, the Shangri-La of Kerala, situated in Melukavu village in Kottayam district is one of the places to visit in Idukki. Located at the foothills of the 3 floral hillocks – Mankunnu, Kudayathur, and Thonippara Hills at Kanjar, the bewitching valley is spread across thousands of acres.

          “Ila-veezha Poonchira” which means “the pond of flowers where the leaves do not fall” has its roots in Mahabharata. The rains during the monsoon season transmogrify the valley and present an enthralling and hypnotic effect on the visitors. Words fall short to explain the beatitudes of the play of colors on the horizon during the Sunrise and Sunset. Ilaveezha Poonchira is also an ideal destination for trekking.
